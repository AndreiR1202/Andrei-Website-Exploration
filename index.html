				The institution was established by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Society_of_Artists"target="_blank">Ontario Society of Artists</a> in 1876 as the Ontario School of Art,[6] whose objective it was to provide professional artistic training, and further the development of art education in Ontario.[7][note 3] The Ontario Society of Artists passed the motion to "draw up a scheme" for a school of art on 4 April 1876, and the first Ontario School of Art opened on 30 October 1876, funded by a government grant of $1,000. The school opened at 14 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Street_(Toronto)"target="_blank">King Street</a> West with an initial enrolment of 14 students.[8]
				<br><br>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mower_Martin"target="_blank">Thomas Mower Martin</a> was the founding director until 1879.[9][10] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Harris_(painter)"target="_blank">Robert Harris</a> taught at the school as did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cruikshank_(painter)"target="_blank">William Cruikshank</a>, who also served as president from 1884 to 1886.[11]

				<br><br>
				In 1882, the provincial department of education assumed control over the institution and relocated the school to the Toronto Normal School building.[8][12][13] In 1886, the school was relocated to another location on Queen and Yonge Street, and renamed the Toronto Art School.[14][15]
				<br><br>
				The Ontario Society of Artists resumed its sponsorship of the institution in 1890 and relocated the institution to 173 King Street West, occupying the upper levels of the Princess Theatre building, and shared the premises with the Art Museum of Toronto.[16] The society reopened the school as the Central Ontario School of Art and Industrial Design.[8]

				In 1910, the school was relocated to 1 College Street as a result of the Princess Theatre's demolition.[16]
				<br><br> 
				In 1912, the institution was granted a charter by the province and incorporated as the Ontario College of Art (OCA) and was relocated back to the Toronto Normal School.[16] The new charter granted the institution the authority to issue diplomas.[17] George Agnew Reid was named the school's first principal.[18] Reid designed the first building owned by the college, a purpose-built two-storey building fronting onto Grange Park. The building was the "first building in Canada built specifically for the education of professional artists and designers." The college relocated to the new property in 1921.[19][20]
				<br><br>
				As a part of Reid's wider efforts to have visual arts accepted as a part of the province's education system, Reid had pushed for the OCA to become a constituent college of the University of Toronto so OCA students could obtain degrees. However, the potential amalgamation was never pursued.[16]
				<br><br>
				Inside a class at the Ontario College of Art in 1931. In 1945, the school established a design school, broadening its education mandate.[21] By the 1950s, the institution had expanded beyond its campus, operating classes in Port Hope, Ontario, and assumed control of the William Houston Public School (presently part of York University's Glendon Campus). In 1957, it opened its first expansion to its main building.[22]
				<br><br>
				In 1971–72, Roy Ascott radically challenged the pedagogy and curriculum structure of the college.[23]: 41–68  In 1974, the institution established its Florence foreign exchange program, where a building in Florence was leased to house studio spaces for students in the program. The program was staffed by the institution's faculty members until the program's cancellation in 2017.[24][25]
				<br><br>
				The main campus was significantly enlarged during the 1980s.[8] From 1979 to 1997, the institution also held classes at the Stewart Building, a building located north of the main campus.[21]
				<br><br>
				The institution remained the Ontario College of Art until 1996 when it was renamed the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD).[21] The name change was intended to raise the institution's media and industrial profile, as well as better position it for a transition from a diploma- to the degree-granting institution.[26] In the following year, the university entered into a partnership with Open University to provide OCAD students with the opportunity to obtain an Open University degree.[21]

				In 2002, the provincial legislature granted university status to OCAD along with the limited authority to confer bachelor's degrees in fine arts and design in its name. In 2007, OCAD was given limited authority to confer graduate degrees and accepted its first cohort of graduate students the next year.[17] In 2008, the college was granted membership into the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada.[21] In 2009, the university began to provide continuing education services.[21]
				<br><br>
				The institution saw changes in its pedagogy early into Sara Diamond's tenure as OCAD's president (2005 to 2020). She emphasized academics over studio time, increasing the independence of the academic deans and requiring full-time instructors to hold a graduate degree.[8] There was some controversy as two faculty members resigned over the changes.[27] Diamond also changed the curriculum to reduce the amount of classroom time versus studio time, increased the academic rigour the program, and pushed for digital media and design research classes.[8]
				<br><br>
				In 2010, the institution was renamed the Ontario College of Art and Design University.[8] In the same year, Tom Traves, then president of Dalhousie University in Halifax, conducted a confidential review of how OCAD was managed. He found that the number of senior faculty and administrators was excessive. Diamond adopted most of his 30 recommendations, including increased Decanal autonomy.[28]
				<br><br>
				OCAD University was awarded full degree awarding powers including the power to confer honorary degrees on 1 July 2020 by the Government of Ontario.[29]

					Campus
				</h2>

			<p>
				The university's campus is spread across several buildings within downtown Toronto. The largest cluster of buildings, including the Main Building, is located in the Grange Park neighbourhood around McCaul Street between Dundas and Queen Street. The university also operates several buildings south of Grange Park in the Entertainment District on Richmond Street West, and a satellite campus in East Bayfront.
				<br> <br>
				The Grange Park cluster includes the Main Building (including the George Reid Wing and the Rosalie Sharp Centre for Design), the Annex Building, the Rosalie Sharp Pavilion, 49-51 McCaul Street, and 74–76 McCaul Street. The George Reid Wing and 74–76 McCaul Street are both designated buildings under the Ontario Heritage Act.[30] The latter building is rented out by the university to a privately run art supply store.[31]
				<br> <br>
				The university operates three buildings in the Entertainment District, 205 Richmond Street West and 230–240 Richmond Street West. The former building was acquired by the university in 2007, while the latter two interconnected buildings were acquired the following year.[21] In addition to university facilities, 230–240 Richmond Street West also holds spaces leased to WeWork. In 2020, Sun Life Financial and BentallGreenOak acquired a 50 per cent ownership stake in 230–240 Richmond Street West from the university.[32]
				<br> <br>
				The East Bayfront "waterfront campus" is located at 130 Queens Quay East and occupies 1,300 square metres (14,000 sq ft) of leased space. The waterfront campus houses OCAD U CO, a business incubator operated by the university.[33] The building forms a part of a larger complex, the Daniels Waterfront—City of the Arts, which also holds George Brown College's waterfront campus.[34]
				<br> <br>
				The university is considered a commuter school, as the university does not operate a student housing service or have any student residences on its campus.[4] However, the university does operate other student facilities like a student centre, opened at 51 McCaul Street in 2007.[21]
